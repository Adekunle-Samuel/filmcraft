# filmcraft-h264

Clean-room, pure-Rust (no `unsafe`) H.264 / AVC decoder, implemented from the public ITU-T
Rec. H.264 (ISO/IEC 14496-10) specification. It is an L0 crate: it depends only on
`filmcraft-bitstream`, `thiserror`, and optionally `rayon` (default feature `threads`), and builds
for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.

All syntax tables (CAVLC code tables, the 1024 CABAC `(m, n)` context initialisation pairs,
`rangeTabLPS`, scaling defaults, deblocking thresholds, the 8x8 significance-map tables) were
extracted from the specification text (the extraction scripts only read the ITU-T PDF). No code was
taken or ported from FFmpeg, x264, JM or openh264. ffmpeg/libx264 are only used as external test
oracles and fixture generators.

## Supported

- NAL units: Annex-B byte streams and length-prefixed (`avcC`) samples; SPS (all fields incl.
  VUI/HRD, scaling lists with fall-back rules A/B, cropping, high-profile fields), PPS (incl.
  `transform_8x8_mode`, scaling lists, slice groups parsed), SEI / AUD / filler skipped.
- Slice header: all fields incl. reference list modification, prediction weight table and
  decoded reference picture marking. POC types 0, 1, 2. `frame_num` gap handling ("non-existing"
  frames).
- Entropy coding: CAVLC and CABAC (all syntax elements needed for frame coding, 4:2:0).
- Macroblocks: I (Intra 4x4 / 8x8 / 16x16, I_PCM), P (all partitions, P_8x8ref0, P_Skip),
  B (all partitions and sub-partitions, B_Skip, B_Direct_16x16, B_Direct_8x8), spatial and temporal
  direct prediction with/without `direct_8x8_inference`, constrained intra prediction.
- Transforms / quantisation: 4x4, 8x8, Intra16x16 DC Hadamard, 2x2 chroma DC; flat and custom
  scaling matrices (SPS and PPS level).
- Inter prediction: quarter-sample 6-tap luma, eighth-sample chroma, explicit and implicit weighted
  prediction, multiple reference frames, long-term references.
- DPB: sliding window, all MMCOs (1-6), IDR / `no_output_of_prior_pics`, bumping with DPB size from
  the level (or VUI `max_dec_frame_buffering`) and `max_num_reorder_frames`.
- Deblocking filter: full bS derivation, `disable_deblocking_filter_idc` 0/1/2, slice offsets,
  8x8-transform edges.
- Output: cropped 8-bit planar 4:2:0 pictures in output order with the caller's `pts`, POC, key
  flag, VUI colour description (range, primaries, transfer, matrix) and sample aspect ratio.
- Frame-level multithreading (see below).

## API

```rust
use filmcraft_h264::Decoder;

let mut dec = Decoder::new(); // or Decoder::with_threads(n), Decoder::from_avcc(&avcc)?
for (pts, access_unit) in access_units {
    for pic in dec.decode(access_unit, pts)? {
        // pic.width / pic.height (cropped), pic.y / pic.u / pic.v, pic.y_stride / pic.uv_stride,
        // pic.pts, pic.poc, pic.key, pic.color, pic.sar
    }
}
for pic in dec.flush() { /* ... */ }
if let Some(err) = dec.take_error() { /* error reported by a decoding thread */ }
```

`decode` expects whole access units (a buffer with several complete access units — e.g. an
entire Annex-B file — also works). `Decoder::stats()` returns counters of the coding tools seen
(macroblock types, slice types, MMCOs, long-term marks, frame_num gaps, ...).

### Threading model

The calling thread parses headers and performs all POC / DPB / reference-list bookkeeping (it only
needs header data). The macroblock layer of each picture is decoded as a job on a rayon pool. A job
reconstructs into private buffers, deblocks each macroblock row once the row below it is
reconstructed, and publishes finished rows (samples + motion data for co-located lookups) into the
picture's shared `Frame` (`OnceLock` per macroblock row). Jobs of later pictures block per row on
exactly the reference rows they read, so many pictures decode concurrently while the output stays
bit-exact. Without the `threads` feature (or on wasm, or with `with_threads(1)`) jobs run inline.
With threads, `decode` returns pictures once their job has finished, so output lags input by up to
roughly the number of threads.

## Tests

`cargo test -p filmcraft-h264` (fixtures are generated on first use into `target/fixtures/h264/`
with ffmpeg + libx264; tests print a message and skip when `/opt/homebrew/bin/ffmpeg` is absent).

- Unit tests: CAVLC tables (prefix-freeness / Kraft sums, spec-style residual example), CABAC engine
  (context init formula, round trip against an encoder model), intra predictors with hand-computed
  values, transforms, luma interpolation against a straightforward reference implementation,
  weighting, macroblock type tables, scaling-list parsing.
- Synthetic streams (`src/synth_tests.rs`): hand-built CAVLC and CABAC bitstreams covering what
  libx264 never produces — I_PCM, long-term references, MMCO 1-6, `frame_num` gaps, reference list
  modification (short- and long-term), explicit weighted prediction in P and B slices, B_Skip with
  explicit bi-prediction. The expected output is known exactly and is also checked against ffmpeg.
- Robustness: avcC input with pts round trip; randomly corrupted, truncated and garbage input never
  panics or deadlocks (single- and multi-threaded).
- Conformance (`tests/conformance.rs`): every fixture is decoded single-threaded and frame-threaded
  and compared byte-for-byte with `ffmpeg -f rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p`; on mismatch the first
  differing frame, plane, sample position and macroblock are reported. Output pts/POC order is
  checked too.

### Fixture matrix (all bit-exact, single- and multi-threaded)

libx264 fixtures unless noted; the VideoToolbox (hardware encoder) fixtures are skipped where that
encoder is unavailable.

`cargo test --release -p filmcraft-h264 --test conformance coverage_report -- --ignored --nocapture`
prints which coding tools each fixture exercises.

## Performance

`cargo test --release -p filmcraft-h264 --test perf -- --ignored --nocapture` (1080p High profile,
CABAC, B-pyramid, 120 frames, 8.8 Mbit/s; bit-exactness is verified first). Measured on an Apple M4
Pro (14 cores) while the machine was heavily shared (load average 40-180), so these are lower bounds:

| threads | fps |
|---|---|
| 1 | ~100-115 (≈ 36 Mcycles per frame) |
| 14 | ~570-600 |

The example `cargo run --release -p filmcraft-h264 --example h264dec -- in.h264 out.yuv` decodes a
file; `H264_BENCH_ITERS=n` (and `H264_THREADS=t`) turns it into a benchmark, `H264_STATS=1` prints
the coverage counters.

## Known gaps

- Interlaced coding (field pictures, PAFF, MBAFF): streams with `frame_mbs_only_flag = 0` return
  `Error::Unsupported`.
- Only 8-bit 4:2:0. High 10 / 4:2:2 / 4:4:4 / monochrome and lossless
  (`qpprime_y_zero_transform_bypass`) return `Error::Unsupported`.
- FMO (slice groups), SP/SI slices, data partitioning (Extended profile), MVC/SVC NAL units.
- Error concealment is minimal: undecodable slices leave the prediction/previous content; missing
  references are replaced by other references.
- Single-threaded speed has no SIMD-specific code yet (the hot loops are written to auto-vectorise).

### Extending to High 10 and 4:2:2

The chroma format and bit depth are isolated behind `Sps::check_supported`. The parts that are
format-specific today: `Planes`/`FrameRow` sample type (`u8`; a `u16` variant or a generic sample
type is needed for bit depths > 8, together with `Clip1` ranges, `QpBdOffset` in the QP
derivations and the scaled tC0/alpha/beta in deblocking), chroma block geometry (`MbWidthC` /
`MbHeightC` = 8x8 in `slicedec`, `intra::pred_chroma`, the chroma DC transform and the CABAC/CAVLC
chroma DC parsing — the 2x4 total_zeros tables and ctxBlockCat 3 `NumC8x8` handling are already in
place), chroma motion-vector vertical scaling and the chroma deblocking edges (4:2:2 has four
horizontal chroma edges).
