# filmcraft-av1

Clean-room, pure-Rust (no `unsafe`) AV1 decoder, implemented from the public **AV1 Bitstream &
Decoding Process Specification, version 1.0.0 with Errata 1** (AOMediaCodec/av1-spec, git
commit `5e04f3f`, 2023-06-12). It is an L0 crate: it depends only on `filmcraft-bitstream`,
`thiserror` and (optional, feature `threads`) `rayon`, and builds for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.

All constant tables (default CDFs, scan orders, quantiser lookups, filter taps, …) and the
named constants are extracted from the specification's Markdown source by
[`tools/extract_tables.py`](tools/extract_tables.py) into `src/spec_tables.rs` (every table's
shape is checked against its declared dimensions; one missing comma in the spec's
`Split_Tx_Size` initialiser is reported and repaired). No code was taken from libaom, dav1d,
SVT-AV1 or any other implementation; ffmpeg (libsvtav1 to encode fixtures, libdav1d to decode the
reference) is used only as an external test oracle.

## Accuracy

`tests/oracle_intra.rs` encodes all-intra streams with ffmpeg's libsvtav1 (in-loop filters off)
and compares every decoded frame with libdav1d: **bit-exact** on all fixtures (8- and 10-bit
4:2:0; 128×128 to 1280×720 including odd sizes; testsrc2, mandelbrot and noise; presets 2–8).

## API

```rust
let mut dec = filmcraft_av1::Decoder::new();
for sample in samples {                  // one temporal unit (MP4 / Matroska sample) each
    for pic in dec.decode(&sample)? {    // shown frames, planar u16
        // pic.width, pic.height, pic.bit_depth, pic.planes[0..3]
    }
}
```
