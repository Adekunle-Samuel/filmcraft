# filmcraft-platform

OS media integration for FilmCraft (layer L5): hardware video decoding through the operating
system's codecs, behind `filmcraft_codecs::VideoDecoder`, and hardware H.264 and H.265 (HEVC)
encoding, behind `filmcraft_export::VideoEncoder`. It holds OS media FFI and nothing else.
It is the one crate of the workspace allowed to contain `unsafe`, under the rules of
[ADR 0001](../../docs/adr/0001-platform-ffi.md) and [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) §0.3.

```rust
// at startup (the desktop app, filmcraft-cli, the bench)
let availability = filmcraft_platform::register(); // Available("VideoToolbox") on macOS
```

## What it does

- **macOS: VideoToolbox H.264 (`avcC`) and HEVC (`hvcC`)**, 8- and 10-bit, 4:2:0 and 4:2:2
  (`videotoolbox.rs`). The session is created from the sample entry's parameter sets with a
  hardware decoder *required*; samples go in as `CMSampleBuffer`s with asynchronous decompression
  (two access units in flight); the output callback copies each NV12 / P010-style biplanar
  `CVPixelBuffer` into planar `Yuv8` / `Yuv16` (chroma deinterleaved, 10-bit samples shifted down
  from the high bits, cropped to the conformance window when the buffer is the coded size). A
  reorder buffer of the stream's own depth (`max_num_reorder_frames` /
  `sps_max_num_reorder_pics`) restores presentation order; a run starting at an HEVC CRA leaves
  out its RASL pictures, as our decoder does. Each seek (`reset`) starts a fresh session.
- **Other systems:** `register()` does nothing and returns `Availability::Unavailable`.
- **`HybridDecoder`** (`hybrid.rs`, safe code): the hardware decoder plus the means to build our
  software decoder for the same `SampleEntry` (`filmcraft_codecs::software_video_decoder`). On a
  mid-stream failure (decode error, invalidated session, changed in-band parameter sets) it replays
  the samples since the last restart point (IDR / IRAP; for an HEVC CRA the one before, so its RASL
  pictures decode) through the software decoder, drops pictures already returned, keeps the ones
  the hardware had decoded but not returned, and stays in software for that instance. The replay
  log is bounded (600 samples / 256 MB); beyond it one error is returned and the next seek restarts
  in software. Streams our decoders cannot decode (HEVC 4:2:2) have no fallback: the error stands.

## Hardware H.264 encoding (macOS)

`videotoolbox_encode.rs` (FFI) wraps a VideoToolbox compression session with a hardware encoder
*required*; `hardware_encode.rs` (safe code) is the `VideoEncoder` adapter and the factory that
`register()` puts in front of the built-in encoders (`filmcraft_export::register_encoder`).

- **Opt-in per export:** `ExportSettings::hardware_encoding` (`Off` | `Auto`; Export ▸ Video ▸
  Hardware Encoding, `"hardwareEncoding": "off|auto"` in `file.exportMedia`), off by default. The built-in encoder's
  output is byte-identical on every machine; a hardware encoder's depends on the machine.
- **What it takes:** H.264 in MP4 / MOV, 8-bit SDR, even picture sizes up to 8192, Baseline / Main /
  High (the level is chosen by the OS), constant or one-pass variable bitrate with the settings'
  target and ceiling, the keyframe distance (closed GOPs: every keyframe is an IDR picture).
  Pictures are converted exactly like the built-in encoder's (BT.709, limited range), 4:2:0 NV12.
- **No B-frames.** On real 1080p footage the quality is the same with and without them (±0.3 dB at
  equal bitrate) and the bitrate lands closer to the target without them, so frame reordering is
  off: compressed frames come out in presentation order, with no composition offsets or edit list.
- **What it declines** (the built-in encoder is used, nothing fails): the setting off, other formats,
  MXF (Annex B), two-pass VBR, HDR, odd sizes (4:2:0 cannot crop an odd number of samples),
  non-square pixels, and any configuration VideoToolbox cannot create a hardware session for
  (logged at `info`).
- **A hardware encoder that fails in the middle of an export is an error**, unlike the decoder:
  an encoder cannot hand a half-written stream to another one, so the export stops with the reason.
- The first frame is completed straight away: the SPS / PPS the container needs come with the first
  compressed frame, and the muxer asks for them after the first group of pictures.

## Hardware H.265 (HEVC) encoding (macOS)

The same session wrapper, created for `kCMVideoCodecType_HEVC` with the HEVC Main profile
(`VtProfile::HevcMain`: the profile also says which codec the session is). `Format::Hevc` has no
built-in encoder, which changes three things from H.264:

- **Choosing the format is the opt-in.** No `hardware_encoding` setting: Export ▸ Format ▸ H.265
  (HEVC), or `"format": "hevc"` in `file.exportMedia` (`h265` is accepted too). The format is
  listed as available only on a machine with a hardware HEVC encoder: `register()` hands
  `hardware_encode::hevc_available` (one small hardware session, created on the first question) to
  `filmcraft_export::register_format_probe`.
- **There is no fallback encoder.** What the hardware path does not take is an error, not a
  different encoder: two-pass VBR is refused up front (`ExportSettings::validate`), HDR sequences
  are exported as SDR (the H.265 path is 8-bit), and odd sizes, non-square pixels or a machine
  without the encoder end in "H.265 (HEVC) encoder not available yet".

The sessions are created with a hardware encoder *required*, and `VtEncoder::uses_hardware()` asks
VideoToolbox whether it agrees (`UsingHardwareAcceleratedVideoEncoder`; a test checks it for H.264 and
HEVC), so a requirement dropped by accident could never turn into a silent software encode. Export
mode says "Encoder: Hardware" for H.265, and the summary line "HEVC Main (hardware encoder)".

What it takes is H.264's list: MP4 (`hvc1`, the tag QuickTime reads) or QuickTime, AAC
audio, 8-bit 4:2:0 BT.709 limited range, even sizes up to 8192, constant or one-pass variable
bitrate, the keyframe distance (closed GOPs, IDR pictures), and no B-frames. Keyframes are the
random access points of types 16–21 (BLA, IDR, CRA).

The sample entry's `hvcC` record is the one VideoToolbox wrote for the stream (read from the
format description's sample description extension atoms, with the VPS / SPS / PPS), so profile,
level and flags are the encoder's own. If it is missing the export stops with that reason.

## Guarantees

- **Never undecodable:** the factory declines (returns `None`, so the software decoder is used)
  when Settings ▸ Playback ▸ Hardware decoding is Off, for formats it does not take (field-coded
  H.264, bit depths other than 8 / 10, 4:4:4 or monochrome, luma / chroma depth mismatch, larger
  than 8192×8192) and when VideoToolbox cannot create a hardware session.
- **Interchangeable:** colour, pixel aspect, pts, presentation order, `is_random_access` and
  `is_disposable` come from the software decoders' own helpers (`filmcraft_codecs::hw`,
  `video::vui_color`, `sar_par`).
- **Never crash:** no `unwrap` / `expect` / `panic!` outside tests; the output callback runs under
  `catch_unwind`; every `unsafe` block has a `// SAFETY:` comment; the public API is safe.
- **Counted:** `perf.stats` `decode.hardware` (frames, software frames, sessions, declined,
  fallbacks; `filmcraft_codecs::hw::hw_stats`).

## Tests

| test | what |
|---|---|
| `tests/videotoolbox.rs` (macOS) | H.264 High, HEVC Main (open GOP: CRA + RASL) and HEVC Main 10, 640×360 (coded 368: cropping) with B-frames: every picture **bit-exact** with our software decoder, same pts order, count, colour and aspect, also after `reset` + reseek to every later sync sample, mid-stream `flush`, and a full pass after resets; forced mid-stream failures (`VtDecoder::fail_after`) at five points continue with the software decoder's exact output; seeded mutation of samples and parameter sets (bit flips, truncation, corrupt length prefixes) never panics or hangs; HEVC 4:2:2 10-bit is bit-exact with ffmpeg's decode |
| `tests/fallback.rs` (every OS) | `HybridDecoder` with a stand-in hardware decoder failing after N samples (every sync sample ± a few, first / last sample, after a seek): output identical to the software decoder; in-band parameter sets identical to the sample entry's stay in hardware, different ones switch to software |
| `tests/setting.rs` | Hardware decoding Off gives the software decoder through `make_video_decoder` and the media stack (no hardware frames); Auto gives VideoToolbox where available |
| `tests/hardware_encode.rs` (macOS) | what the hardware path takes and declines; round trip through our software decoder (every picture, in order, luma PSNR above 30 dB, keyframes no further apart than asked, no composition offsets); an export through `filmcraft_export` that decodes in our decoder and in ffmpeg / ffprobe (profile, size, frame count, BT.709); the built-in encoder still exporting everything hardware declines; exact output size at sizes that are not multiples of 16; hostile configurations (zero, huge, odd sizes, frame rates, bitrates, keyframe intervals, wrong planes) give errors and never panic; encoders dropped at any point do not crash or hang. The same for **HEVC**: Main profile, 8-bit 4:2:0, `hvc1` entry with VPS / SPS / PPS and 4-byte lengths, MP4 and QuickTime, AAC audio, two-pass refused, the format list agreeing with the probe, ffprobe reading `codec_name=hevc`, `profile=Main`, `codec_tag_string=hvc1`, `pix_fmt=yuv420p`, BT.709 |

Fixtures are made with ffmpeg into `target/fixtures/platform/` (generator only, never linked);
tests skip without ffmpeg or without a hardware decoder.

Hardware H.264 encoding, Apple M1 (8 cores), single runs: 1080p25 camera footage through the
encoder alone 200 fps at 4, 8 and 16 Mb/s (8× real time); a 9:29 timeline (camera clip, ProRes 4444
overlays, AAC, loudness) exported in 311 s against 793 s with the built-in encoder (84 s against 395 s
for its densest 134 s), the outputs at SSIM 0.990 / PSNR 46.5 dB. Details in

204 s, both bound by the CPU compositor); same picture quality at 10 Mb/s and above, and 22–31 % less
bitrate for the same PSNR at 3–6 Mb/s ([docs/performance.md](../../docs/performance.md), HW3).
