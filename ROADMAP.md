# FilmCraft Roadmap

Progress toward feature parity with Adobe Premiere Pro, with estimates. Updated as milestones land.

**Last updated:** 2026-10-02 · **Overall parity:** ~58% · **Code:** 34 crates, 1095 tests

## Estimate to parity

Throughput observed so far: ~25% parity in the first ~5 wall-clock hours (Sep 30, 05:22 → 10:00), with
3–4 coding agents running in parallel and one integrator. The early percentage points were the cheap
ones; the remaining work is broader, with a long tail of commands, dialogs and edge cases.

| | Agent-hours | Wall-clock (4–6 parallel agents, 24/7) |
|---|---|---|
| Feature parity by checklist | ~350–500 | **~100–150 h (4–6 days)** |
| Robust on real-world material (codec edge cases, 4K/8K performance, pro workflows) | +150–300 | **+1–2 weeks** |

Limits on speed: machine load (builds and benchmarks slow down under many agents), disk space, and a
single integrator merging and checking each agent's work. With one agent and no parallelism, multiply
wall-clock by ~3–4.

Not reachable clean-room and locally: **Generative Extend** (needs a large video-generation model).
**Enhance Speech** and **Auto Reframe** are feasible only with openly licensed models we can ship.
